        <p>This site will provide talented artists who believe that 
            their art deserves to be recognized. Furthermore, users will be able to
            purchase any sort of non-digital art they see fit. Examples include arclyc and oil paintings. 
            Lately, there has been a push toward digital art and NFTs. Non-digital painters feel like their
            paintings are on their way to becoming obsolete. Therefore, Arto will provide these artists with
            the chance to shed light on their paintings and spread it all around the world.
